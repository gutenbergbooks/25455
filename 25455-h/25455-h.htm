<h1>THE SONG OF THE FLAG.</h1>

<h2>I.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Up with the country's flag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the winds caress it, fold on fold,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stainless flag, and glorious to behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is our honour's pledge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the token of a truth sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thing to die for, and to wonder at,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, on the shuddering edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some great storm, it waves its woven joy,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which no man shall destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shine or shower, in peace or battle-time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up with the flag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds are wild to toss it, and to brag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of England's high renown,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the throne where Chivalry has sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acclaimed in bower and town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For England's high renown!&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And of these happy isles where men are free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And masters of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The million-mouth&euml;d sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That calls to us from shore to furthest shore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fought for us of yore,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder-throated, foam-frequented sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sounds the psalm of Victory evermore!<br /></span>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">For England's sake to-day,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for this flag of ours which, to the blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfurls, in proud array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its glittering width of splendour unsurpassed,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For England's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For our dear Sovereign's sake,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cry all shame on traitors, high and low,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whose word let no man take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose love let no man seek throughout the land,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traitors who strive, with most degenerate hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring about our country's overthrow!<br /></span>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">The sun reels up the sky, the mists are gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And overhead the lilting bird of dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has spread, adoring-wise, as for a prayer,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Those wondrous wings of his,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which never yet were symbols of despair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the feathery foeman of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shakes adown the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Song-scented trills and sunlit ecstasies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye! 'tis the lark, the chorister in gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sings hosannas to the lord of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And will not stint the measure of his lay<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As hour to hour, and joy to joy, succeeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he's the morning-mirth of English meads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we who mark the moving of his wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know how sweet the soil whereof he sings,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How glad the grass, how green the summer's thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How like a gracious garden the dear Land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That loves the ocean and the tossed-up sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the wind has made a coronal;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And how, in spring and summer, at sun-rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds fling out their raptures to the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have the grace of God upon them all.<br /></span>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Up with the flag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up, up, betimes, and proudly speak of it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lordly thing to see on tower and crag,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With eyes a-fire, and wings of phantasy,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our memories hang superb!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of our full sway; and they shall sham&eacute;d be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wrong, with sword or pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Code that keeps us free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there's no sight, in summer or in spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like our great standard-pole,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When round about it ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cheers of Britons, bounden, heart and soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deeds of duty, dear to Englishmen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who serves it has a name to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Victory's muster-roll;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who loves it not, how vile is he!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'tis the Land's delight,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our ocean-wonder, blue and red and white;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Blue as the skies, and red as roses are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white as foam that flashed at Trafalg&agrave;r;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Land's delight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The badge and test of right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girt with its glory like a guiding-star!<br /></span>

<p class="hd4">LOVE LETTERS</p>
<p class="hd5">OF A VIOLINIST</p>

<p class="hd2"><span class="fxl">By ERIC MACKAY</span></p>

<p class="hd1"><span class="smcap">London: Lamley &amp; Co., Exhibition Road, S.W.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Love Letters of a Violinist.</span>'&mdash;Letters to make the ordinary
writer envious, and to awaken in lovers thanks to the poetical pen
that has given forth utterances so suited to their good health or
malady. Here a verse to cheer the almost hopeless; a stanza to teach
the refraining a lesson in charge and capture; lines to fall in love with
the memory, to charm the darkness, and be another light to rule the
day. London was yawning behind her giant hand. The moment was
propitious, and any strain of beauty was sure of an audience. At this
felicitous moment a pipe of splendour sounded. London ceased to
yawn. A violinist was communicating the passions of his heart to
those who would listen, and amid great interest he went from house
to house a-singing.... Eric Mackay is one of those wise men
who have no immature volumes to haunt them. He first asked right
of way on the road to Parnassus with a bundle of melodies which have
never lost their appeal. While youth seeks the pink cheek, these
Love Letters will command the homage of lovers. Your Petrarchs
are not as common as sparrows.... These outpourings from a
burning heart will always compel the student of our literature to weigh
them, sift them, and establish them in some very honourable position.
The charm of this early book is its freedom from drag. It moves
on always. The reader is hastened along; he has wonderful and
unexpected views, which ravish him as the abrupt magnificences of
the Pyrenees ravished Gautier. Perhaps you expect a tree, but you
see a stream. Now, at last, it must be a great green hill, and behold!
you peep down into an echoless mossy depth of glen. At the next
break in the quick, up towers a height of fancy and simile! Thus the
everlasting surprise goes on enchanting. From wild to wild, from
passion to passion, from cavern to star, are we borne, and as we travel
there is music about us&mdash;music of the true tone, ringing with all the
natural pathos of lyrical carelessness. There have been instances in
literature of the music mastering the thought, but in the case under
notice the proportions are justly ministered to. There is thought and
witchery of measure. The ice of craftsmanship is mingled with the
wine of passion."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Norman Gale</span>, in <i>The Literary World</i>, March
10th, 1893.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We are indebted to Eric Mackay for the latest ode to the lark,
one of peculiar gracefulness and impassioned beauty. In my opinion,
this is a better production than either of Wordsworth's, superior to
Hogg's, and, though not so intellectual as Shelley's, rivals it in truth.
Mackay's is the lark itself, Shelley's is himself listening, with unwearied
ears and tightly-stretched imagination, to the lark. Who is surprised
that Eric Mackay's lyric, 'The Waking of the Lark,' sent a thrill
through the heart of America? This poem, which appeared in the
<i>New York Independent</i>, is undoubtedly the lark-poem of the future.
From the opening to the closing stanza there is not an imperfect verse,
not a commonplace. The sentiment is pure, and the fancy glowing.
It is, indeed, an exquisite ode."&mdash;<i>Wintringham's</i> "<i>Birds of Wordsworth.</i>"
Edition, 1892.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"He (the lecturer) ventured to call the author of the 'Love Letters'
a new poet. His published volume is a work of immense promise.
His fancy is splendid.... The 'Love Letters' are twelve poems,
separate, and yet intrinsically one. It is a compound lyric, with an
epic theme and somewhat of an epic cast. The theme is the triumph
of woman's love. It is the story of love's redemption. It has something
of the tone, colour, and luxuriance of Solomon's Song; both,
too, have the same theme, though treated in a different way....
The form is charming&mdash;as if the sonatas of Beethoven had been
translated into poetry! The <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> is reached when Beethoven
himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;">
<span class="i0">'The giant-singer who did storm the gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Heaven and Hell'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">is introduced in a vision. The lecturer gave a number of quotations to
illustrate his points."&mdash;<i>Lecture on</i> <span class="smcap">Eric Mackay</span>, <i>by the Rev. Elvet
Lewis, at the Hull Literary Institute.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The 'Love Letters' of Eric Mackay are the handiwork of a
brilliant metrical artist and poet born.... A beautiful and
passionate work; its beauty that of construction, language, imagery,&mdash;its
passion, characteristic of the artistic nature, and, while intensely
human, free from any taint of vulgar coarseness.... The poem
is quite original, its manner Elizabethan.... Eric Mackay
is a lyrist with a singing faculty and a novel metrical form such as few
lyrists have at command. With the very striking poem of 'Mary
Arden,' we have at last something new said of Shakespeare, and it is
said sweetly and imaginatively."&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. C. Stedman</span>, in "<i>Victorian Poets</i>,"
